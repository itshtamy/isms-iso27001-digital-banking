## 📖 Overview

This repository documents the design of a full **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** for a fictional Saudi bank, built against **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** and informed by **SAMA** cybersecurity expectations and the **PDPL** (Saudi Personal Data Protection Law, SDAIA).

**Phase 1 Scope:** securing the bank's digital banking channels — **Afaq Plus** (mobile app) and **Afaq Net** (internet banking) — together with their supporting infrastructure, Riyadh primary data center, Security Operations Center (SOC), Jeddah disaster recovery site, and related cloud (AWS) and third-party dependencies.

The documentation follows the **Plan → Do → Check → Act (PDCA)** lifecycle and covers everything from organizational context and scope definition to internal audit and performance evaluation.

### Project at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| In-scope assets | **117** assets across 7 categories |
| Assessed risks | **20** (10 asset-based + 10 scenario-based) |
| Highest risk scores | **20** — SQL Injection & Credential Theft |
| Annex A controls in SoA | **93** (all applicable) |
| Performance KPIs | **24** RAG-tracked measures |
| Internal audit result | **1 minor NC** (Clause 6.2), 0 major NC |
| Security budget context | SAR 12M → SAR 18M post-implementation |

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- **Risk-based Phase 1 scope** — digital channels prioritized; branches, ATMs and full core-banking systems excluded with justified controlled dependencies.
- **Evidence-driven risk register** — every risk carries likelihood/impact scoring, Annex A mapping, treatment action, owner, and post-treatment residual level (7 High → 0 High after planned treatment).
- **Traceability by design** — unique asset IDs (IA-xxx, SW-xxx, HW-xxx) link the inventory to risks, controls, baselines, incidents and performance KPIs.
- **Hardest incidents turned into controls** — a 3-hour firewall misconfiguration outage, an unencrypted laptop loss, and phishing results directly shaped the treatment plan.
- **Honest readiness snapshot** — internal audit (1 minor NC on objectives planning) and a 24-KPI RAG dashboard show exactly where maturity stands before certification.
